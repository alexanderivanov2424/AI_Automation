The goal is to see major colors like red, green, blue in the major clusters and then as clusters split the parts retain the colors of the parent cluster. This should result in a plot where the changing colors show the gradients in cosine similarity and regions that have a single material/spectra will have a single almost unchanged color.\n",

Instead of just considering the two neighbors and scaling the split in the range between them, the entire hue spectra is considered and all the clusters so far mapped are placed proportionally to the similarity of their neighbors."

Computing a similarity of two spectra based on the number of peaks not present in the other results in a plot where key regions are identifiable. To determine if a peak is present in both plots a \"delta\" parameter is used as the maximum allowed peak shift. Withing this delta two peaks are considered to be the same. This value was picked based on the resulting plots so a method to properly determine the value before hand is necesary. Furthermore, many clusters that should be whole are split up by this method.
