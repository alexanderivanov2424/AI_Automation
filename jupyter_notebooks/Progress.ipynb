    "Implementing a phase coloring based on relative similarity. The goal is to see major colors like red, green, blue in the major clusters and then as clusters split the parts retain the colors of the parent cluster. This should result in a plot where the changing colors show the gradients in cosine similarity and regions that have a single material/spectra will have a single almost unchanged color.\n",

    "Initial implementation:\n",
    "Start with 3 clusters and assign then the colors red, green, blue. Then proceed to split clusters based on the hierarchical clustering method. Each time a cluster is split the the neighbors in the color wheel N1, N2 and the two children clusters C1, C2 are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The children's colors are assigned such that the hue difference between N1 - C1 - C2 - N2 is proportional to the similarity of the pairs. The order of C1,C2 (N1 - C1 - C2 - N2 vs. N1 - C2 - C1 - N2) is determined by the similarity of C1 and C2 to N1. The more similar pair is used."

    "Wafer coloring implemented with following results. Because of the use of the cosine the clusters of interest are not segmented. THe general region of the cluster is found but the specific points are not identifiable. Furthermore, there is a clear split in shade through the desired cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan is to adjust the coloring to be on a linear scale. Ideally this would mean that red and green colors are the furthest from each other and the rest are some combination. Also when a cluster is split all other colors are shifted based on the similarity of the corresponding clusters. Instead of just considering the two neighbors and scaling the split in the range between them, the entire hue spectra is considered and all the clusters so far mapped are placed proportionally to the similarity of their neighbors."
