_____________________________

General:

various clustering and clustering related scripts.



_____________________________
Files:

cluster_split_analysis - Script for analyzing the differences between clusters and
                         for determining relative similarity between cluster centers

clustering_colors_linear - Scrip for visualizing how clusters are splitting in
                           terms of order and location in the grid.

clustering_colors_progression - Script for visualizing the progressive splitting of
                                clusters.

clustering_colors - Script for visualizing the way clusters split in a given clustering

clustering - Script for producing a cosine clustering for a range of clusters.

clusterplots - Diagnostic script for comparing produced clusterings

naive_peak_clustering - Hierarchical clustering based on the number of differences
                        in located peaks.

PCA_clustering - Hierarchical clustering on top of full data PCA transformation.
                 Uses various distance metrics for final clustering.

similarity_plot_analysis - Diagnostic Script to show various diffraction patterns
                           side by side. Also computes cosine similarity.

similarity - Neighbor based cosine similarity plot. Also shows clustering results
             from another group in red.
