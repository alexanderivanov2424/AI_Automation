Files:

DBSCAN_AGG - Script to cluster peaks with DBSCAN and then perform hierarchical
             clustering on the dimensionality reduction.

DBSCAN_PCA_AGG - Same ass DBSCAN_AGG but with a PCA dimensionality reduction
                 before clustering.

peak_error_plot - Script to visualize errors in peak BBA curve fitting algorithm

peak_finding_plot - Script to manually record peak positions, used by peak_error_plot

peak_finging_plot - Script visualizing peaks found by peakBBA

peak_heat_map - Script to visualize a heatmap plot of a wafer slice.

peak_hill - Script to cluster peaks based on generated point density

peak_map_clustering - clustering peaks on the heatmap plot from peak_heat_map

peak_plot_analysis - Script for plotting diffraction patterns and detected peaks.

unique_peak_plot - Script to visualize unique peak vectors from peak reduction
