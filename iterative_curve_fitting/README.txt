linkage_clustering_on_heatmap - linkage clustering algorithm performed on a slice
                                (a slice is often referred to as a heat map)

linkage_clustering - script to perform linkage clustering across full wafer.
                     Plots: PCA components, PCA clustering, 2D layers, 3D layers

peak_plot - diagnostic script to show individual patterns and detected peaks.

peaks_on_heat_plot - script to visualize detected peaks (iter curve fit algorithm)
                     on a wafer slice heat map plot.
